# Domain-Driven Design Starter Modelling Process

This process gives you a step-by-step guide for learning and practically applying each aspect of Domain-Driven Design -- from orienting around an organisation's business model to coding a domain model.

> This process is for beginners. It is not a linear sequence of steps that you should standardise as a best practice. Domain-Driven Design is an evolutionary design process which necessitates continuous iteration on all aspects of knowledge and design.
